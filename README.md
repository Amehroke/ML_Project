# Machine Learning Project

## Description

This Machine Learning Project is meticulously designed to demonstrate the power and versatility of machine learning models across different domains. The project is structured into three distinct parts, each focusing on a unique application of machine learning techniques:

### Part 1: Digit Recognition using Logistic Regression

In the first part of this project, we tackle the classic problem of digit recognition. Utilizing the MNIST dataset, a logistic regression model is developed to identify handwritten digits. This section includes:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.
- Model training with logistic regression.
- Model fine-tuning through cross-validation.
- Analysis of model performance to assess its effectiveness in digit recognition.

### Part 2: Digit Classification with Random Forest

Building on the foundation laid in Part 1, the second part employs a Random Forest classifier to approach the digit recognition task, offering a comparison between different machine learning methodologies. This part covers:

- In-depth EDA to further explore the dataset.
- Employing Random Forest for its robust classification capabilities.
- Fine-tuning model parameters via cross-validation for optimal performance.
- Comprehensive performance analysis to evaluate improvements over the logistic regression model.

### Part 3: Song Year Prediction from Timbre Features

The final part of this project showcases the application of machine learning in the music industry. By extracting timbre features from songs using Spotify API calls, we develop a model capable of predicting the release year of songs. This section entails:

- Extraction of timbre features through Spotify API.
- EDA to explore the relationship between timbre features and the songs' release years.
- Model training and parameter tuning aimed at predicting the release year with high accuracy.
- Performance evaluation, focusing on achieving predictions within a year or two of the actual release dates.
